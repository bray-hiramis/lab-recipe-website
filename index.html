        <h1>Garlic Butter Chicken Recipe</h1>
        <p>Garlic Butter Chicken is a simple yet flavorful dish that combines tender, juicy chicken breasts with a rich, buttery garlic sauce. The chicken is seared to perfection, creating a crispy golden-brown crust, while the melted butter and garlic infuse it with a deliciously savory aroma. A hint of paprika and oregano adds depth to the flavor, making this dish both comforting and satisfying. Garnished with fresh parsley and served with a squeeze of lemon, this easy-to-make meal is perfect for a quick dinner or a special occasion.</p>
